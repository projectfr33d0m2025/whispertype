## Executive Summary

WhisperType v1.3.0 introduces **Meeting Transcription** - a major feature that transforms WhisperType from a quick voice-to-text tool into a comprehensive meeting productivity assistant. Users can record meetings up to 90 minutes, view live subtitles during recording, and receive AI-powered summaries with speaker identification after the meeting ends.

### Key Value Propositions

1. **Privacy-First Meeting Recording** - All transcription happens locally, unlike cloud-based competitors (Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai)
2. **Works with Any App** - Generic system audio capture works with Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, or any application
3. **No Subscription Required** - Free alternative to Teams Premium transcript feature
4. **Customizable Summaries** - User-defined templates for different meeting types

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

1. **Microsoft Teams transcript is not free** - Requires Teams Premium or specific licensing
2. **In-person meetings have no transcript** - Conference room meetings without video calls lack documentation
3. **Cloud transcription services raise privacy concerns** - Sensitive business discussions sent to third-party servers
4. **Generic summaries don't fit all needs** - Different meeting types require different summary formats

### Target Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Remote Meetings** | Teams/Zoom calls where user wants private, local transcription |
| **In-Person Meetings** | Conference room discussions captured via laptop microphone |
| **Hybrid Meetings** | Mix of remote and in-person participants |
| **Personal Notes** | Recording personal voice memos or brainstorming sessions |

```swift
// Using ScreenCaptureKit (macOS 13+)
import ScreenCaptureKit

class SystemAudioCapture {
    func startCapture() async throws {
        let config = SCStreamConfiguration()
        config.capturesAudio = true
        config.excludesCurrentProcessAudio = true // Don't capture WhisperType's own audio
        
        // Capture all audio, not tied to specific window
        let filter = SCContentFilter(display: display, excludingWindows: [])
        
        let stream = SCStream(filter: filter, configuration: config, delegate: self)
        try await stream.startCapture()
    }
}
```

### F2.5 Permission Handling

**Required Permission:** Screen Recording

**Flow:**
1. First attempt to capture system audio
2. If permission not granted → Show explanation dialog
3. Guide user to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording
4. User enables WhisperType
5. User restarts WhisperType (required by macOS)
6. System audio capture now works

**UI Text:**
```
"System Audio Permission Required"

To record audio from Microsoft Teams and other apps, WhisperType needs 
Screen Recording permission. This is required by macOS for capturing 
application audio.

Your screen content is NOT recorded - only audio is captured.

[Open System Settings]  [Use Microphone Only]
```

```

**Live Subtitles (Pass 1 - During Recording):**
- Buffer: 60 seconds of audio (prioritizes accuracy over latency)
- Process: Every 60 seconds (clean chunks, no overlap)
- Vocabulary: Uses VocabularyManager hints for domain-specific terms
- Threading: Background queue, UI updates on main thread
- Trade-off: ~60 second delay for near option-space accuracy

**Final Transcript (Pass 2 - After Recording):**
- Loads all saved WAV chunks and concatenates audio
- Transcribes full audio in segments to preserve timing information
- Groups text into ~30-second blocks with `[HH:MM:SS]` or `[MM:SS]` timestamps
- Uses vocabulary hints from VocabularyManager
- Saves to `transcript.md` and `transcript.txt` in session folder

- Posts `meetingTranscriptReady` notification for UI display

**Window Management Strategy (CRITICAL):**
To prevent "Zombie Object" crashes (EXC_BAD_ACCESS) on macOS, all auxiliary windows (`LiveSubtitleWindow`, `ProcessingIndicatorWindow`, `TranscriptResultWindow`) MUST implement the **Singleton + Persistent State** pattern:
- **Singleton:** The `NSWindow` is created once and reused. It is NEVER deallocated.
- **Persistent State:** The SwitUI view observes a persistent `ObservableObject`.
- **Behavior:** "Closing" a window hides it (`orderOut`) but keeps the object alive. This ensures that pending SwiftUI animations and Combine subscriptions do not trigger crashes during autorelease pool drains.

### F3.5 Content Display Rules

| Element | Display |
|---------|---------|
| **Timestamp** | `[HH:MM:SS]` format, gray color, above text block |
| **Text** | Plain transcribed text, no speaker labels |
| **Paragraphs** | New paragraph every ~30 seconds or on detected pause |
| **Formatting** | No formatting (bold, italic, etc.) in live view |

### F3.6 Window Behavior

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Close button (×) | Hide window, recording continues |
| Minimize button (–) | Minimize to dock, recording continues |
| Menu bar → "Show Live Transcript" | Re-open window (unhide) |
| Recording stops | Window hides (persists in background) |
| App loses focus | Window can stay visible (always on top) |

## F4: Speaker Diarization

### F4.1 Overview

Identify and label different speakers in the transcript after the meeting ends. Uses pyannote.audio for accurate diarization with a fallback to basic voice clustering.

### F4.2 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| F4.2.1 | Identify distinct speakers in audio | Must |
| F4.2.2 | Label speakers as "Speaker A", "Speaker B", etc. | Must |
| F4.2.3 | Align speaker labels with transcript segments | Must |
| F4.2.4 | Allow user to rename speakers after meeting | Must |
| F4.2.5 | Work without Python/PyAnnote (basic clustering) | Must |
| F4.2.6 | Better accuracy with PyAnnote (optional) | Must |
| F4.2.7 | Support 2-10 speakers | Must |
| F4.2.8 | Processing time < 50% of meeting duration | Nice |

### F4.3 Two-Tier Approach

**Tier 1: Basic Voice Clustering (No Dependencies)**
- Built-in Swift implementation
- Uses audio feature extraction + k-means clustering
- Accuracy: ~70-75%
- Always available

**Tier 2: PyAnnote.audio (Optional, Better Accuracy)**
- Requires Python + pyannote.audio
- Uses neural speaker embeddings
- Accuracy: ~85-90%
- Optional HuggingFace token for best models

### F4.4 PyAnnote Setup Flow

### F5.6 LLM Fallback Strategy

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| LLM available | Generate full summary with template |
| LLM unavailable | Provide transcript only, show message |
| LLM times out | Retry once, then fallback to transcript |
| Partial failure | Show what was generated + error message |

**Fallback Message:**
```
"Summary generation unavailable. Your full transcript is saved below.

To enable AI summaries:
• Local: Install Ollama and run 'ollama pull llama3.2:3b'
• Cloud: Add your API key in Settings → Processing"
