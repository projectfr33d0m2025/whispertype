      "text": "Sure. Thanks, Alex. So based on customer feedback from last week, we're prioritizing the notification system redesign. Users have been complaining about missing important alerts. I've written up the requirements, and I think we can ship this in two sprints."

      "end": 55.6,
      "text": "From a design perspective, I've already started on the mock-ups. I'm thinking we go with a notification center approach, similar to what iOS does. Users can see all their notifications in one place and manage their preferences easily."
